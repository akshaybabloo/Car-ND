## Documentations

To build Python documentations

Make sure you have installed [Node.js 6](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Once you have installed `Node.js`, do the following

1. Open the `Car-ND` folder in `terminal` or `Command Prompt`.
2. Type in the following once
    ```
    npm install
    ```
3. To build the Python docs, type in
    ```
    gulp
    ```

**or**

Open `docs` folder in `Command Prompt` or `Terminal` and type in

```
make html
```

If there are no errors, the `index.html` will be in `build/html/index.html`, double clicking that will open in a web browser.

## Term 1

Term 1 is mainly focused on finding the lanes and objects correctly using various algorithms and computer vision.

### 1 Finding Lanes

In this section we were introduced to the basic knowledge of Computer Vison using [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/). The files are available [here](https://github.com/akshaybabloo/Car-ND/tree/master/Term-1/Finding_Lane_Lines).

More on this in my blog [Part 1.1 Car-ND: Detect road lanes using Computer Vision and Python 3](https://blog.gollahalli.com/blog/29/1/2017/part-1-1-car-nd-detect-road-lanes-using-computer-vision-and-python)

### 2 MiniFlow

A Stochastic Gradient Descent based Backpropogation algorithm to minimise the error.

Files can be found [here](https://github.com/akshaybabloo/Car-ND/tree/master/Term_1/MinFlow)

### 3 TensorFlow

An introduction to [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org).

Files can be found [here](https://github.com/akshaybabloo/Car-ND/tree/master/Term_1/TensorFlow)

### 4 Deep Neural Network

Files for DNN can be found [here](https://github.com/akshaybabloo/Car-ND/tree/master/Term_1/DeepNeuralNetwork_4).

### 5 Convolutional Neural Network

Files for CNN can be found [here](https://github.com/akshaybabloo/Car-ND/tree/master/Term_1/CNN_5)

### 6 Traffic Sign Classifier

Files for CNN can be found [here](https://github.com/akshaybabloo/Car-ND/tree/master/Term_1/TrafficSignalClassifier_6)

### 7 Keras
