## Term 1

Term 1 is mainly focused on finding the lanes and objects correctly using various algorithms and computer vision.

### Finding Lanes

In this section we were introduced to the basic knowledge of Computer Vison using [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/). The files are available [here](https://github.com/akshaybabloo/Car-ND/tree/master/Term-1/Finding_Lane_Lines).

More on this in my blog [Part 1.1 Car-ND: Detect road lanes using Computer Vision and Python 3](https://blog.gollahalli.com/blog/29/1/2017/part-1-1-car-nd-detect-road-lanes-using-computer-vision-and-python)

### MiniFlow

A Stochastic Gradient Descent based Backpropogation algorithm to minimise the error.

Files can be found [here](https://github.com/akshaybabloo/Car-ND/tree/master/Term_1/MinFlow)

### TensorFlow

An introduction to [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org).

Files can be found [here](https://github.com/akshaybabloo/Car-ND/tree/master/Term_1/TensorFlow)
