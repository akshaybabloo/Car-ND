Perspective Transform
=====================

A perspective transform maps the points in a given image to different, desired, image points with a new perspective. The perspective transform you’ll be most interested in is a bird’s-eye view transform that let’s us view a lane from above; this will be useful for calculating the lane curvature later on. Aside from creating a bird’s eye view representation of an image, a perspective transform can also be used for all kinds of different view points.
