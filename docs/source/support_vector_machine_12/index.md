Support Vector Machine
----------------------

SVM takes in the data and try's to separate a two class problem by drawing a line, also know as the hyperplane.

It tries to maximise the margin between a data.

When trying to classify the data, SVM follows two principals;

1. Separate the data correctly
2. Then maximise the margin.

SVM Kernels
-----------

Converts the non-separable data and transforms it into higher dimensions, so that the data can be easily separable.
